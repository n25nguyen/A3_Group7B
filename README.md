## Project Title
GBDA 302 A3 Final Game: NekoBeat
---
## Group Number
7B

---
## Description
NekoBeat is a rhythm-based game where players press keys in time with falling beats. Blocks move toward a hit bar and the player must press the corresponding key when the beat reaches the correct timing zone, the `Hit Bar`.

The game focuses on rhythm recognition, reaction speed and timing accuracy. Visual feedback and sound cues help guide the player and reinforce successful or missed inputs. The design was inspired by rhythm games such as piano-tile style gameplay, where the challenge comes from matching inputs with musical timing.

Players experience a progressively engaging loop where they attempt to maintain rhythm accuracy while reacting quickly to incoming beats.

## Interaction Instructions
1. Open the GitHub Pages link for the project.
2. The game will load automatically in your browser.
3. The splash screen titled `NekoBeat` will appear.

## Starting the Game
When the game opens, the player first sees a Home screen with two buttons:

- `Play` – starts the game
- `Instructions` – opens the Instructions screen explaining the controls and gameplay

Players can read the instructions before starting or immediately begin playing.

## Controls
The rhythm gameplay uses two keyboard keys:

- `F` key – hit the left beat
- `J` key – hit the right beat

After completing level 1, the next levels add more keys:

- 'D', 'K', and space bar

Players must press the correct key when the falling beat reaches the `Hit Bar` at the bottom of the screen.

## Gameplay
- Beats fall from the top of the screen toward the hit bar.
- The player presses `F` or `J` when the beat reaches the bar.
- Correct timing and key input will register a successful hit.

## Game Interface
- A `PAUSE` button appears in the top right corner during gameplay, allowing players to pause the game at any time.
- A 'MUSIC' button also appears next to the pause button, allowing players to mute the music at any time.
- Players can also return to the Home screen during gameplay by clicking the`< BACK` button in the top left corner.

## Gameplay Feedback
- All `F` and `J` keyboard inputs trigger audio feedback as a sound effect.
- Successful hits trigger visual feedback, generating a burst animation and text feedback (`Early`/`Perfect`/`Late`) depending on the accuracy of the hit.
- Mistimed inputs will end the game, textual feedback indicating that a beat was missed.
- The objective is to maintain rhythm accuracy and hit as many beats correctly as possible, finishing all levels.

## Iteration Notes (Post-Playtest)
Playtesting Summary:

During playtesting, the player generally found the rhythm game concept straightforward and engaging. However, they experienced difficulty understanding the correct timing window for pressing keys. The player asked whether they should press the key before or after the block reaches the line, indicating uncertainty about when inputs should occur.

The hit bar also felt too strict, making it difficult to land precise hits. This caused the player to sometimes spam keys in order to register a successful input.

Another issue observed was that mistakes reset the sequence too quickly. This prevented the player from understanding what they did wrong. The player suggested clearer feedback when mistakes occur to improve learning.

Despite these challenges, the player remained motivated and interested in the game. They responded positively to the visual design and background graphics, noting that the game reminded them of piano-tile style rhythm games.

The player also suggested possible features that could increase engagement, including animations, combo systems, score tracking, power-ups and new mechanics introduced across levels.

### Three Changes Implemented Based on Playtesting

**1. Improve Timing Feedback**

Players had difficulty understanding the correct timing window. To address this:

- Added visual tap feedback when a key is pressed (flash or glow effect), as well as audio feedback (sound effect)
- Added indicators showing whether an input was `Early`/`Perfect`/`Late`

These changes help players learn the timing window more quickly and reduce key spamming.

**2. Adjust the Hit Window and Error Feedback**

The hit bar originally felt too strict and mistakes reset too quickly.

Changes made:

- Slightly increased the hit window tolerance
- Added visual feedback when a mistake occurs before offering players the option to restart

These changes make the gameplay feel fairer and easier to understand.

**3. Add Progression Elements to Increase Engagement**

To make gameplay more rewarding:

- Considering adding a scoring system (more points accrued for more accurate hits)
- Considering introducing combo tracking for consecutive successful hits
- Began planning additional mechanics that can appear in later levels

These changes encourage players to improve performance and maintain rhythm accuracy.

## Iteration Notes (Post-Showcase)

Showcase Summary:

During the showcase, players generally enjoyed the rhythm-based gameplay and visual style. However, several issues were identified:

1. **Sound effects:** The synth/laser sound effect when pressing keys became jarring and distracting after repetitive hits during gameplay.
2. **Visual alignment:** The blue cat character appeared slightly off-center, affecting the visual balance.  
3. **Music synchronization:** The beats of the music did not always align with the falling blocks, creating timing confusion.
4. **Challenge simplification:** No need for additional complex mechanics or challenges to be added.

### Changes Implemented / Planned

**1. Update Tap Sound Effect**  
- Replaced the original synth/laser sound with a more subtle and satisfying sound that is easier to listen to repeatedly.  
- Ensures players can audibly confirm successful inputs.

**2. Adjust Character Position**  
- Moved the blue cat character slightly to the left to create a more visually balanced layout.

**3. Sync Music to Beats**  
- Planning to lock music tracks to the `draw()` loop to ensure beats align with frame rate of falling blocks.  
- Future improvements will include exploring JS libraries that provide precise audio-to-frame syncing.
- Instead of rushing to finish this mechanic by the A2 deadline tonight, we will be implementing this for A3 to ensure high quality work is being delivered.

**4. Challenge simplification**
- We will keep the game mechanics simple; instead of introducing many new and different challenges, we will nail the core mechanic of hitting the keys to the rhythm of the music.
- Difficulty progression will be executed through this core musical rhythm mechanic.

## Iteration Notes (Post-A3-Showcase)

Showcase Summary:

After playtesting with peers, several key areas for improvement were identified:

1. Hit Bar Effectiveness
The vertical movement of the hit bar did not significantly impact gameplay difficulty or player experience.

2. Hit Bar Visibility
The hit bar was not visually distinct enough, making it harder to judge when notes should be hit.

3. Lack of Dynamic Difficulty
Gameplay difficulty remained relatively constant and did not scale with player performance (e.g., streaks or combos).

4. Control Progression Confusion
Introducing multiple new keys too quickly (e.g., D and K in Level 2) felt overwhelming.

5. New keys introduced in later levels were not clearly communicated

6. Audio & Visual Consistency
Playtesters asked for different songs for the different levels, allowing for variety and fun.

### Changes Implemented

1. Hit Bar Redesign
Removed/reduced vertical movement
Added white outline and transparency

2. Dynamic Difficulty (Screen Shake)
Added screen shake effect during high combos/streaks

3. Improved Level Progression
Level 2: Introduces Spacebar
Level 3: Introduces D and K

4. Instruction UI Improvements
Added visual boxes around F and J keys

5. Gameplay UI Enhancements
Displayed current level during gameplay
Added live score (and combo) display

6. Level Complete Screen Updates
Shows which level was completed
Displays score using star visuals
Increased star size and removed unnecessary text

7. Pause & Audio Feedback
Added “PAUSED” overlay on dimmed screen
Added mute/music toggle button

8. Audio & Visual Updates
Set chill.mp3 as background music for non-gameplay screens
Updated background images
Refined button UI and hit feedback visuals

9. Control Communication Improvements
Added UI updates after Level 1 to introduce new keys
